# Bike_Sales_Dasboard
Data did not need much cleaning only some additional column and grouping by using excel formulas, I focused on pivot tables and dashboard
# Covid19_Data_Analysis
I have merged two datasets to see if there is any interesting relationship between variables
Steps are described in the notebook 
Final results: Developed countries are more prone to getting the infection. Maybe it is because Less covid testing is done in poor countries, this requires more analysis
Also death rate shows tendencies to be higher in developed countries, this may be due to better kept statistics
# HR_Analytics_Dashboard
I have created demographics page that gives us the overall demographic outlook
of the organization. Then I've created pie charts and doughnut charts to visualize gender & racial diversity. 
At the end I have created an employee detail page that
provides you with all the important information about any employee with just a click.
# Power_BI_Clean_Transform
This is another small project that I did while learning power BI and working with data in it. 
It is mainly based on data cleaning, transformation, merging, appending, data types and importing data from csv and web
# Python_For_Data_Analysis
This is a little project I did while reminding myself how to use numpy and pandas
